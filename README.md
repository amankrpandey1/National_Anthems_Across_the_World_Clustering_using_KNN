# National_Anthems_Across_the_World_Clustering_using_KNN

In this notebook, we will utilize the k-means algorithm, which is a popular unsupervised clustering method, to group the national anthems of different countries into distinct clusters. The main goal of k-means is to identify similar data points and uncover underlying patterns. The algorithm works by searching for a fixed number of centroids (k) in a dataset. A centroid represents a cluster, which is a group of data points that are similar to each other based on certain criteria. The "means" in k-means refers to the computation of the average of the data points in a cluster to determine its centroid. The algorithm is unsupervised since we do not have any prior knowledge of the classes or groups in the dataset, and k-means discovers the underlying groups on its own.
